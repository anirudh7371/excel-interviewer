## API Endpoints

  * `POST /api/sessions`: Create a new interview session.
  * `GET /api/sessions/{session_id}/question`: Get the next question for a given session.
  * `POST /api/sessions/{session_id}/answer`: Submit an answer for a given question.
  * `GET /api/sessions/{session_id}/report`: Get the final report for a given session.
  * `GET /api/health`: Health check endpoint.

## Database Schema

The database consists of three tables:

  * `questions`: Stores the interview questions with their category, difficulty, question text, type, canonical answer, alternatives, explanation, and tags.
  * `sessions`: Stores information about each interview session, including candidate details, status, scores, and timestamps.
  * `answers`: Stores the user's answers for each question in a session, including the user's answer, score, time spent, feedback, and whether it was a follow-up question.

## Future Improvements

  * Add support for more question types, such as practical Excel exercises.
  * Implement user authentication and accounts to track progress over time.
  * Implementing proctoring features to ensure the integrity of the interview process.
  * Add more detailed analytics and visualizations to the report.
  * Improve the AI's ability to understand and evaluate more complex answers.
